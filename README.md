# Ricing Arch Linux

## Foreword

### Who is this guide for?

Those who are interested in ricing or would like to know what it is, whether they are experienced Linux users or complete beginners.

Those who want control over the way their desktop enviroment [DE] looks, far beyond the offerings of Windows and OS X.

Those who dislike extra/undeeded features cluttering their DE. With ricing and Linux in general, you can keep what you want/need and remove everything else. This is especially helpful for older systems.

### Hold up... "ricing"?

If the term confuses you, you aren't alone. You're probably thinking, what does rice have to do with computers, at all? Below is the definition of ricing taken from [u/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/):

> "Rice" is a word that is commonly used to refer to making visual improvements and customizations on one's desktop. It was inherited from the practice of customizing cheap Asian import cars to make them appear to be faster than they actually were - which was also known as "ricing". Here on /r/unixporn , the word is accepted by the majority of the community and is used sparingly to refer to a visually attractive desktop upgraded beyond the default.

There's not a lot going on, right? Yeah, that was the whole point. I mostly use Firefox and a powerful yet lightweight text editor called Vim. I don't need much. It's my personal set-up and what I'm using at the time of writing. If you want more, this guide will teach you the basics and provide a set-up to 'improve' on with your own needs in mind.
